	* 0.6.0: 
	- When a database path is passed as a command line argument, an error occurs.
	  This is because the original TkSQLite assumes that it is wrapped by Starkit while I used TclApp.
	  TclApp is variant of Starkit but it does not set _startdir global variable.
	  But I guess this version works even when you use Starkit.
